# cpre281 Final Project
Designed and implemented a stopwatch using Intel Quatrus Prime (BDFs and Verilog) on an FPGA board. The FPGA Programmed stopwatch was equipped with the following features:
- The Time Period of the Clock was slowed from 50Mhz to 1Hz using down counters to simulate the working of an actual stopwatch.
- The stopwatch could count up, reset, and store lap times using register files.
- The user could also toggle between the active stopwatch and stored lap times.
